            <thick>Overview</thick><br>
            You begin with two types of chips: AND and NOT. These simple built-in chips can be used to create your own custom chips, each<br>
            of which can then be used inside of the next one, allowing you to build up layers of increasing complexity<br><br>

            <thick>How to Create Chips</thick><br>
            New chips can be created from the menu in the bottom-left of the editor.<br><br>

            Input and output pins can be added to the new chip by clicking on the bars on the left and right edges of the editor. These pins will<br>
            display their state (0 or 1) as a circle of dark or light color. The state of the input pins can be toggled by clicking on them.<br><br>

            To add previously-created chips into the new chip, simply select them from the bar along the bottom of the editor. These "sub-<br>
            chips" can then be connected to the input/output pins of the new chip (or to one another) by clicking on the pins to create wires.<br><br>

            Once you're happy with the chip, you can give it a name and save it from the menu.<br>
            You can find all of your created chips (along with a few extra built-in chips) in the Chip Library. From there, you can also delete or<br>
            edit your custom chips at any point.<br><br>
            <thick>Please Note...</thick><br>
            This is a work-in-progress project, which I'm building as part of my video series "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0dPhqVsKt1Ni_46ARyiCGSq">Exploring How Computers Work</a>". It is intended<br>
            only as a fun toy for experimenting with and learning some basic concepts, and not at all as a serious simulation tool.<br>
            The simulator currently has many missing features, which I plan to add in the future. Feedback is greatly appreciated.<br>
            Thanks for giving it a try!
